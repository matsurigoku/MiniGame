# MiniGame

Because we are not familiar with programming.

It is hard to decide our topic in a short period of time.

We are still deciding our project topic.

## proposal

 - TicTacToe

 - SnakeGame

## motivation

Although we are not very interest in coding yet.

But we think this is a useful ability.

We decide to make a small project to practice our skill.

## goal

 - object oriented approach

 - modern c++ technique (optional)
